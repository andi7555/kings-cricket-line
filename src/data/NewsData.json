        "content": "Team India wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant was reprimanded for his on-field conduct during England`s first innings of day three in the ongoing Test match in Leeds.He breached Article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for players and players` support personnel, which relates to \"showing dissent at an Umpire`s decision during an International Match.\"According to ICC`s official website, one demerit point has been added to Rishabh Pant`s disciplinary record, for whom it was the first offence in 24 months.In the 61st over of England`s innings, the Indian wicket-keeper was seen having a discussion with the umpires regarding the ball`s condition.Later, umpires checked the ball with the gauge and refused to change the ball. Following the decision, Pant threw the ball on the ground in front of the umpires.There was no disciplinary hearing as Pant admitted to the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Richie Richardson of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees.The charges were brought in by the on-field umpires, Chris Gaffaney and Paul Reiffel, along with the third umpire, Sharfuddoula Ibne Shahid and the fourth umpire, Mike Burns.Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a player`s match fee, and one or two demerit points.The Ben Stokes-led side will resume day five with a score of 21 runs without any loss of wickets. England are still falling short by 350 runs of registering the win at Headingley.Pant has been in exceptional form as the left-hander has smashed centuries in both innings. In India`s first innings, the 27-year-old scored 134 runs in 178 balls, including 12 boundaries and six maximums. In the second innings, he accumulated 118 runs off 140 deliveries. His second innings knock was laced with 15 boundaries and three maximums.Additionally, in the first innings, along with Pant, skipper Shubman Gill and opening batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal were the other centurions for India. Later, in the second essay, Pant was accompanied by KL Rahul for smashing centuries. Rahul accumulated 137 runs off 247 deliveries, including 18 boundaries.(With ANI Inputs)",

Accompanying Rahul was Rishabh Pant, who registered another century in the match. Praising Pant, the right-hander said, Pant has a style that none of us will understand",
        "content": "Team India`s opening batsman KL Rahul has stated that visitors will give themselves the best chance to bowl out England and take a 1-0 lead in the five-match Test series.\"Today was a tricky wicket. Tomorrow it might break even more. We`ll give ourselves the best chance to pick up the 10 wickets,\" said Rahul during the post-stumps press conference.Further, he said that a blockbuster finish awaits, and it gives visitors the opportunity to pick up England`s 10 wickets.\"Blockbuster finish, waiting tomorrow. There`s definitely going to be a result. That`s what England have said openly and it gives us the opportunity to pick up 10 wickets,\" he said.Rahul then opened up on the conversation that took place in India`s dressing room during tea break on day four.\"At tea, there was a little bit of discussion on how much we need, or whether to give them (England) a few overs to bat and pick up a few wickets. Ideally we would have wanted about 40 runs more,\" said the 33-year-old.In India`s second essay, facing 247 deliveries, the right-hander played a knock of 137 runs, including 18 boundaries.India lost three lower-order batters for a duck, while Karun Nair and Shardul Thakur too could only manage a handful of runs as the visitors slumped from 333/5 to 364 all out.Accompanying Rahul was Rishabh Pant, who registered another century in the match. Praising Pant, the right-hander said, Pant has a style that none of us will understand.\"You just stand there and admire and sometimes scratch your head about the shots that he plays. He has his unique style of play. He enjoys his game. He has a style that none of us will understand in this room. Just let him be Rishabh Pant,\" he concluded.After smashing a century in the first innings, Pant yet again scored his second ton in the second innings of the Headingley Test. The left-hander accumulated 118 runs in 140 balls, which was laced with 15 boundaries and three maximums.England pacer Josh Tongue, who ran through the tail to return figures of 3/72, said the first 30-40 minutes in the opening session on the final day would be crucial but the general feeling in the team was to go for victory.\"Go for the chase tomorrow, that`s the messaging in the dressing room. There`s no reason we can`t chase it down. Hopefully we won`t be in a situation to play out for a draw. See where we are at lunch and calculate,\" he said.(With PTI Inputs)",

        "content": "India and England players are wearing black armbands on Day 5 of the Leeds Test in memory of former India spinner Dilip Doshi, who passed away due to cardiac arrest on Monday. India and England players are wearing black armbands on Day 5 of the first Test at Headingley in Leeds in memory of former India spinner Dilip Doshi. Doshi passed away on Monday (June 24) in London due to a cardiac arrest. In addition to wearing the black armbands, the players from both teams observed a minute’s silence before the start of the day’s play. Doshi had recently attended the BCCI Awards function and the World Test Championship final at Lord’s earlier this month. Doshi made his Test debut for India at the age of 32 in 1979 and went on to represent the nation in 33 Tests and 15 ODIs between 1979 and 1983. Known for his classical left-arm spin, he claimed 114 Test wickets, including six five-wicket hauls, and 22 ODI wickets. His career also saw him excel in first-class cricket, where he amassed 898 wickets from 238 matches. England need 350 more to win On Day 5 of the first Test in Leeds, England need to score 350 more runs to win the match and go 1-0 up in the five-match series. India rode on centuries from KL Rahul (137) and Rishabh Pant (118) on Monday to post a total of 364 runs in the second innings and set a target of 371 runs for England to chase down. The hosts finished the fourth day’s play at 21/0 in six overs. Only once in 82 Tests played so far at Headingley in the last 126 years has a team managed to chase down a total of more than 370 runs. The feat was achieved by the Don Bradman-led Australian team against England in July 1948. England’s highest successful run chase in a Test match played at Headingley is 359 against Australia, which he achieved during the 2019 Ashes series.",

        "description": "After India vice-captain Rishabh Pant became the first Indian wicketkeeper to score centuries in both innings of a Test match on Monday, former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar lauded the wicketkeeper-batter's batting feats, saying by end of the five-match series Pant could surpass ex-skipper and coach Rahul Dravid in the list of most Test hundreds by Indians on English soil.After slamming an outstanding 134 in the first innings, Pant continued his magnificent form as he notched up his eighth Test century in the second innings 118 off 140 on Day 4 of the ongoing first Test against England at Headingley.Meanwhile, Pant became the seventh Indian to score centuries in both innings of a Test match, joining an elite list of players featuring Vijay Hazare, Sunil Gavaskar (three times), Rahul Dravid (twice), Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma.Furthermore, the 27-year-old joined the list of Don Bradman, Hansie Cronje, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Kumar Sangakkara and Daryl Mitchell, among visiting batters with five consecutive 50-plus scores in England. The list is headed by Australian talisman Steven Smith (seven).\"When you look at all of Rishabh Pant’s achievements, the first instinct is to think of him purely as a batter - and understandably so. Because when you're talking about batting exploits in England, scoring twin hundreds, the names he’s being compared with are legends like Dilip Vengsarkar, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, and Sunil Gavaskar.\"But here’s the remarkable part - he’s also a wicketkeeper. That’s what makes it almost unbelievable. I know someone like Kumar Sangakkara had a phenomenal batting record, but he wasn’t quite the keeper that Rishabh Pant is,\" Manjrekar said on JioHotstar.With his two centuries in Headingley Tests, Pant's tally of Test tons in England reached four, just two shy of Dravid, and Manjrekar feels that with four Tests to go in the series, Pant could match or surpass the former skipper to become the Indian batter with the most Test hundreds in England.\"Pant is India’s first and last choice as a wicketkeeper in this Test side - and that says a lot. Now, if you look at the numbers - most hundreds by Indians in Tests in England - Rahul Dravid leads with six. And suddenly, you have Pant’s name in that same elite bracket. And there’s a nice little twist - there are two Rahul’s in this story.\"You’ve got KL Rahul, and you’ve got Rishabh Pant. Who knows, by the time this series is done, Pant could match or even surpass Rahul Dravid. There are still four Tests to go in this series - that’s potentially eight innings for Pant. And he’s already started in near-perfect fashion,\" he added.Pant, who was later dismissed for 118 off 140 balls in the second innings, along with KL Rahul, who was also impressive with the bat in the first innings, made it count with his ninth Test century, led India’s charge with the bat to put the tourists in a decent position with one day remaining in Leeds. The duo added 195 runs for the fourth wicket, which is India's highest-ever partnership for the fourth wicket during their second innings of a Test match in England. India were eventually dismissed for 364 in their second innings, setting a total of 371 for England to chase. Speaking about Rahul’s contribution and technique, Manjrekar said, \"The only critique of KL Rahul is consistency - a key yardstick for greatness. But purely on batting mechanism, he’s nearly flawless. Whether in Australia, South Africa, England, or New Zealand, his technique has no visible weakness.\" \"That’s why he’s the ‘Senapati’ (general) of Indian cricket in SENA countries - with five Test hundreds, second only to Sunil Gavaskar among Asian openers. A remarkable feat, though he’d be the first to admit he wants more runs, more often,\" he concluded. (This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

A remarkable feat, though he’d be the first to admit he wants more runs, more often,\" he concluded. (This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

        "description": "Ahead of the first Test against the West Indies, Australia batter Usman Khawaja said he is trying to best player for the side at the opening spot.After the retirement of David Warner last year, Australia have struggled to find his permanent replacement after testing multiple players for the job. For the series against the West Indies, the 19-year-old Sam Konstas has been given the role of rejoining Khawaja at the top after playing two Border-Gavaskar Trophy Tests against India.Meanwhile, the senior batter is aware of his abilities and knows what is his role in the team. \"For me, I feel like I have plenty to give still. To be playing this series and the Ashes is the pinnacle. That's the one we all love winning and being involved in… after that there is a bit of a gap between that and the next Test series. We'll cross that bridge when we get there but for me it's about making sure I stay in the moment. Because if I'm not in the moment, I don't think I'm doing the right thing by myself and the team,\" he said ahead of the opening Test,\" he said.\"I'm not the guy who's going (to say), 'I want to play for another ten years'. I'm very attuned to whatever is best for the team (and that) is what I'm trying to do. I'm not here for myself anymore. I'm here for the team. I could have stopped playing two years ago, really. But I found that I was still contributing, still trying to be the best player for the team at that opening spot, trying to do what I can do, (and) that hasn't changed for me. When it does, you guys will surely find out,\" he added.Khawaja hit a career-best double century earlier this year against Sri Lanka, but questions about his form resurfaced after he registered twin failures against Kagiso Rabada in the World Test Championship final. Those struggles extended a pattern of modest returns against pace bowling, following difficulties against Jasprit Bumrah last season and New Zealand’s quicks earlier in 2024.Despite this, head coach Andrew McDonald, speaking after the Lord’s Test, all but confirmed that Khawaja’s spot is secure for the upcoming Ashes series later this year.Khawaja, who was the second-highest-scoring opener in the previous WTC cycle behind India’s Yashasvi Jaiswal and also Australia’s top run-getter overall, remains confident in his long-term record. He believes any recent dip in form is reflective of the demands of his role, especially during a period where top-order batting has been particularly tough.Since the beginning of 2024, Khawaja averaged 25.29 against pace -slightly below the global average for openers at 27.84 - but fares much better against spin, averaging 65.80.\"I can't understand how I can (have a problem against seam bowling) if I can score so many runs in (Sheffield) Shield cricket or be the highest run-scorer for Australia in the WTC cycle,\" the 38-year-old said.\"I open the batting for Australia. So I get out to seam more than I get out to anyone else. It's just part and parcel of the game.\"I wish I could face more spinners, but you don't always get that opportunity. So, I'm facing the new-ball bowlers with the new ball every single time. I went back from Sri Lanka to domestic cricket and scored a hundred against Tasmania. I pretty much faced seam the whole time there (and) against Riley Meredith, who is one of the fastest bowlers in the country.\"I understand I'm 38 years old. People will be looking for an excuse. (But) I think I've got a role to play: open the batting, starting off, and setting a good platform for Australia,\" he added.On partnering again with Konstas, Khawaja said, \"I knew when and where he was going to drop and run a quick single, and I was ready for it.\"\"There's obviously this series and then a big Ashes coming up. [You] probably want a little bit of stability at the top. It'll be tough to chop and change, and opening is a tough place. Mentally, it can be very tough. Going out there against the new ball and sometimes just getting a good ball and low scores.\"\"I'm just looking forward to playing with Sammy, as much as on the field as helping him off the field. I've been through a lot in my life, a lot of ups and downs. There are lots of things I've seen throughout my career and most of them are not technical. More mindset things. If I can help Sammy through this journey, especially over the next couple of series, try and impart as much knowledge I can to him,\" he concluded.(This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

        "description": "NEW DELHI: Former India left-arm spinner Dilip Doshi, who carved out a niche for himself despite being in the shadows of Bishan Singh Bedi, died due to cardiac arrest in London on Monday, the Saurashtra Cricket Association said. He was 77 and is survived by his wife Kalindi, son Nayan, who has also played first- class cricket, and daughter Vishakha. Doshi made his Test debut in 1979 after Bedi's retirement and played his last of his 33 games in 1983. In those matches, he took 114 wickets with six five-wicket hauls and was exceptional at home during the first three seasons, completing 100 scalps in just 28 Tests. His finest hour was getting five wickets in India's Test win at the MCG in 1981 when the visitors defended a paltry target. Doshi bowled with a fractured toe and was literally unplayable on an up-and-down MCG track. Doshi, Karsan Ghavri and the peerless Kapil Dev won that game for India. He was also a stalwart in English county circuit having plied his trade for more than a decade there. He represented Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire. \"Dilip bhai suffered a heart attack in London. He is no more,\" Saurashtra CA president Jaydev Shah told PTI. \"Dilip's passing away is a personal loss to me. He was like a family. He was one of the finest human beings,\" former BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. In the Indian domestic circuit, he played for Bengal and Saurashtra. In all he had a staggering 898 first-class scalps with 43 five-fors. He was Bengal's go-to man in Ranji Trophy for years. While Bedi remains India's greatest left-arm spinner, Doshi was one of the most accurate bowlers who would flight the ball when required and was very accurate for the better part of his career. The touring Australian, English and West Indies teams found it difficult to handle his arm balls, and it was Javed Miandad, who actually hastened his exit from international cricket during the 1982-83 series against Pakistan. The bespectacled cricketer was a gentleman to the core. Miandad would often tease him by enquiring about his room number in the middle of the game. \"Ae Dilip tela loom number kya hai,\" Miandad would ask in a slurry tone. His batting and fielding in those days wasn't top notch but in that era he could survive because his bowling was from top drawer. He was a close friend of Sunil Gavaskar and the legend was first introduced to his wife Marshaniel by Doshi. After retirement, he had migrated to London where he became a successful businessman. He would divide his time between London, Mumbai and Rajkot, and it was quite strange that the BCCI never bothered to use Doshi's expertise. Former India captain Anil Kumble was among the first to pay his tribute to the late cricketer. \"Heartbreaking to hear about Dilip bhai's passing. May God give strength to his family and friends to bear this loss. Nayan, thinking of you buddy,\" Kumble wrote on X.",

The innings was powered by a brutal 63 off 27 from Parth Chaudhary, who cleared the ropes nine times in a whirlwind knock.Skipper Parth Sahani led from the front perfectly with an unbeaten 72 off 38 balls, while Vikas Sharma chipped in with 41 (28). Gwalior closed their innings strongly with Mangesh Yadav finishing on a quick 16 (4)*.For Chambal, Tripuresh Singh and Aryan Pandey picked up two wickets apiece, but the Cheetahs’ total looked more than competitive.Chambal’s reply began nervously as they lost Apurve Dwivedi early and were 6/1 in 1.1 overs when rain interrupted play. Following a weather-enforced delay, the target was revised to 108 in 8 overs as per the VJD method, still a stiff task needing over 13 runs per over.The Ghariyals also lost Ankush Singh in the same over to Arpit Patel, who picked up both early wickets, but that only brought Harpreet Singh Bhatia and Tripuresh Singh together, and what followed was carnage.The duo stitched an 85-run partnership off just 25 balls, turning the chase into a no-contest. Harpreet was in sublime touch, hammering six fours and five sixes in his knock, while Tripuresh complemented him brilliantly with three fours and two sixes of his own.Chambal chased down the target in just seven overs, sealing a seven-wicket win and marching into the final, where they will meet Bhopal Leopards.This is a remarkable achievement for Chambal Ghariyals, who are playing their first-ever MPL season. The men's team is now into the final, while the Chambal Ghariyals Women are already set to face Bundelkhand Bulls Women in the MP Women's League 2025 final, giving the franchise a chance to win both titles.Player of the Match Harpreet Singh Bhatia said, “We had a clear plan, to play with free hands and contribute, no matter how big or small.

There's definitely going to be a result. That's what England have said openly and it gives us the opportunity to pick up 10 wickets,\" said Rahul, who along with Rishabh Pant, played a pivotal role in propping up India before they were all out for 364.Rahul scored 137 while Pant smashed 118 as the duo stitched together a 195-run stand for the fourth wicket to bail India out after they had lost skipper Shubman Gill early in the morning session.\"Today was a tricky wicket. Tomorrow it might break even more. We'll give ourselves the best chance to pick up the 10 wickets,\" added Rahul during the post-stumps press conference.He, however, conceded that a score of around 400 would have placed India in a much stronger position.\"At tea, there was a little bit of discussion on how much we need, or whether to give them (England) a few overs to bat and pick up a few wickets. Ideally we would have wanted about 40 runs more,\" said Rahul.India lost three lower-order batters for naught, while Karun Nair and Shardul Thakur too could only manage a handful of runs as the visitors slumped from 333/5 to 364 all out.Rahul added that he was in awe of Pant's batting and was just admiring his audacious strokeplay standing at the other end.\"You just stand there and admire and sometimes scratch your head about the shots that he plays. He has his unique style of play. He enjoys his game. He has a style that none of us will understand in this room. Just let him be Rishabh Pant,\" said Rahul of Pant, who, despite playing conservatively, managed 118 off just 140 balls.England pacer Josh Tongue, who ran through the tail to return figures of 3/72, said the first 30-40 minutes in the opening session on the final day would be crucial but the general feeling in the team was to go for victory.\"Go for the chase tomorrow, that's the messaging in the dressing room. There's no reason we can't chase it down. Hopefully we won't be in a situation to play out for a draw.

        "content": "Usman Khawaja will mentor 19-year-old Sam Konstas as they open against the West Indies, replacing Marnus Labuschagne. Experienced Australian batter Usman Khawaja has expressed his readiness to mentor 19-year-old Sam Konstas as they prepare to open together in the first match against the West Indies in Bridgetown. Konstas is set to replace Marnus Labuschagne, who opened with Khawaja in the World Test Championship final but did not perform well, with Australia losing to South Africa by five wickets. “It’s an added role. To help Sammy along through his journey, trying to impart as much knowledge as I can. I won’t be around forever. But it’s very important that I can do whatever I can, obviously first and foremost, have a solid partnership between us but then a bit of stability at the top, but also guide him through this journey,\" Khawaja told reporters ahead of the match starting on Wednesday. When asked about partnering with Konstas again, Khawaja said, “I knew when and where he was going to drop and run a quick single, and I was ready for it.\" He emphasised the importance of forming a solid partnership and providing stability at the top, while also guiding Konstas through his early career. “He’s still very young, he’s a 19-year-old boy, and it’s quite exciting. There’s obviously this series and then a big Ashes coming up.\" For Khawaja, the three-test series is also a chance to address any doubts about his ability to handle seam bowling. The 38-year-old struggled against South Africa, getting out for a duck in the first innings and scoring only six runs in the second, both times falling to fast bowler Kagiso Rabada. “I can’t understand how I can (have a problem against seam bowling) if I can score so many runs in Shield cricket or be the highest run-scorer for Australia in the WTC cycle,\" Khawaja said. “I open the batting for Australia. So I get out to seam more than I get out to anyone else ... I understand I’m 38-years-old. People will be looking for an excuse.\" (With inputs from Reuters)",

        "content": "Ravi Shastri has requested India to find a player like Virat Kohli to pressure opponents, especially on batting pitches like Headingley. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has said that the Indian team needs to get to the face of the opposition, much like what ace batter Virat Kohli did, to keep them under pressure on what has become a fluent batting pitch at Headingley, with England cruising along in the 371-run chase. The current Indian team doesn’t include natural characters for getting on the opposition’s nerves, aside from a chirpy Rishabh Pant and an aggressive Mohammed Siraj. Now that Kohli has retired from Tests altogether, India are in desperate need of a character who can fulfil that role. “What India need today is someone to do a Kohli job, to get in the face of the opposition. Someone has to be designated or given that role. I don’t think there is one guy who could do it, Kohli could do it for three people,\" Shastri said while commentating on Tuesday. Former England captain Michael Atherton said that Siraj is the type of player that can do a similar job, but with his form fledgling, it is doubtful how effective the pacer can be in troubling the England batters. “Siraj is the type of spirit that Ravi Shastri was talking about moments ago, that someone needs to do a Kohli, that was at Lord’s, when he asked his bowlers and fielders to unleash hell. Siraj is that kind of character; he is aggressive and in your face,\" Atherton said. Siraj was embroiled in a fiery war of words with Harry Brook in the first innings. On Monday, Pant indulged in self-reproach before becoming just the second wicketkeeper in cricket’s history to score centuries in both innings of a Test, helping India set England a tricky 371-run target in the series opener in Headingley. Pant, the team’s unflappable maverick with innate confidence in his ability to dominate bowling attacks anywhere in the world, struck 118 off 140 deliveries and added 195 runs for the fourth wicket with the elegant KL Rahul. However, India’s batting crumbled for a second time in three days after the dismissal of the two second-innings centurions, as they were all out for 364 on a riveting day.",

He was part of the IPL 2025 season but his Chennai Super Kings side finished in 10th and last position.On Tuesday, a heartwarming video featuring Dhoni went viral on social media. In the video, Dhoni is seen working out in a gym in Ranchi and seen interacting with former India and Jharkhand teammate Saurabh Tiwary’s son. Tiwary shared a 16-second video on Facebook where Dhoni can be seen playfully interacting with his young son, Sourish, in a gym.Watch MS Dhoni with Saurabh Tiwary’s son Sourish HERE...Tiwary captioned the video, ‘Mahi Bhaiya playing with my son Sourish’ soon went viral. In the video, Dhoni is seen playing with the young boy, charming him with his personality. Tiwary and Dhoni played international cricket together and both represented Jharkhand Cricket Association in first-class cricket as well.In fact the Jharkhand southpaw had made his international debut under the captaincy of MS Dhoni. However, Tiwary played in only 3 ODI matches for Team India.The 35-year-old from Ranchi turned out in six seasons in IPL for Nita Ambani’s Mumbai Indians franchise. In 93 matches in IPL, Tiwary notched up 1494 runs with 8 fifties to his name.He also scored 8076 runs in 116 first-class matches at an average of 47.22 with 22 centuries to his name. After his retirement, Tiwary has become the secretary of Jharkhand State Cricket Association recently.Meanwhile, Dhoni was retained for Rs 4 crore as an uncapped player ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction last year. Dhoni is classified as an ‘uncapped’ player now because he last played international cricket for India more than 6 years back in 2019.In the IPL 2025 season, Dhoni only managed to score 196 runs in 14 matches with a top-score of 30 not out with a strike-rate of 135.17. Overall in IPL, Dhoni has played in 278 matches and scored 5439 runs with 24 fifties.",

        "content": "KL Rahul showcased his class in the second innings of the first match and played a superb knock of 137 to put India in a strong position in the Headingley Test. KL Rahul scripted history after smashing a fantastic century in the ongoing first Test of the five-match series between India and England at Headingley, Leeds. Rahul looked solid in the first innings as well but he got out for 42 after playing an ordinary shot. However, he showcased his class in the second innings and played a superb knock of 137 to put India in a strong position in the Headingley Test. With his fantastic knock, Rahul scripted history and became the Indian opener with most Test centuries in England (3). He surpassed Rahul Dravid, Sunil Gavaskar and others for a massive milestone. Most Centuries By An Indian Opener In England 3 - KL Rahul 2 - Rahul Dravid 2 - Sunil Gavaskar 2- Vijay Merchant 2 - Ravi Shastri The 33-year-old Rahul also joined Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag and other Indian batters in an elite list. Most 50+ Scores For An India Opener In SENA Countries 19 - Sunil Gavaskar (57 inns) 9* - KL Rahul (42 inns) 9 - Virender Sehwag (49 inns) 9 - Murali Vijay (42 inns) Rahul stitched a brilliant stand of 195 runs for the fourth wicket with Rishabh Pant to put India in a strong position in the ongoing first Test. India were eventually dismissed for 364 in their second innings, setting a total of 371 for England to chase. Sanjay Manjrekar On KL Rahul's Batting Technique Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar feels that KL Rahul's batting technique has no visible weakness. \"The only critique of KL Rahul is consistency - a key yardstick for greatness. But purely on batting mechanism, he’s nearly flawless. Whether in Australia, South Africa, England, or New Zealand, his technique has no visible weakness,\" said Manjrekar. \"That’s why he’s the ‘Senapati’ (general) of Indian cricket in SENA countries - with five Test hundreds, second only to Sunil Gavaskar among Asian openers. A remarkable feat, though he’d be the first to admit he wants more runs, more often,\" he added.

        "content": "Alyssa Healy is expected to return to action in August, when Australia A face India A in Queensland. Australia women’s team captain Alyssa Healy has dismissed the idea of retiring after the upcoming ODI World Cup, stating that a series of injuries have only strengthened her desire to continue playing at least until the series against India in 2026. The 35-year-old wicketkeeper-batter has faced numerous injuries since last year, beginning with a stress fracture in her foot during the T20 World Cup, followed by a knee issue that kept her out of several matches. Healy, who has often joked about considering retirement, admitted she had initially thought about retiring after the ODI World Cup in India this year. However, her outlook has changed. “It’s probably shifted a little bit. The injuries have made me realise that I still want to do a little bit more than maybe what I thought,\" Healy told the Australian Associated Press (AAP). Although she played intermittently during Australia’s successful Ashes campaign at home, Healy missed tours to New Zealand and the Women’s Premier League in India. “At the same time, sometimes there are things in life that are a little bit more important than pulling on the green and gold. So it’s just a constant reassessment. “But at the moment I definitely want to play a home summer. I want to bring the World Cup home, but also to play against India in 2026 at home,\" she added. Healy is set to return to action in August when Australia A faces India A in Queensland. Australia, the most successful team in women’s cricket, aims to become the first team in nearly four decades to win consecutive ODI World Cups, a goal that fuels Healy’s determination. “According to science, the ODI World Cups is one of the heaviest loads that we go through as cricketers. My aim is to play every game of that World Cup. So, making sure I can do that is important.\" “That was one of my goals, putting a timeline on it and saying this is where I could take this group, even without knowing what I was going to do personally,\" Healy said. “It was definitely a big focus of mine, to get the group to a place where it can not just compete but win the trophy.\" “It’s not so much about the captaincy, or ticking one more box at a personal level. It’s just that I want to win a World Cup for Australia, and no one has gone back-to-back, which is a real motivator.\" “That was a big focus of mine — to get this group to a place where it can not just compete but win.\" “It’s not about ticking a personal box or just the captaincy. I want to win a World Cup for Australia. No team has gone back-to-back — and that’s a real motivator,\" she added.",

        "content": "Shubman Gill at press conference (PTI Photo) NEW DELHI: As India gear up for their high-stakes five-match Test series in England, Shubman Gill stepped into the demanding role of Team India's Test captain. On Thursday, he attended his first official press conference in that capacity. Seated beside head coach Gautam Gambhir at the BCCI headquarters, the 24-year-old star batter appeared reflective yet composed as he addressed the media. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! In a video posted by BCCI today, Gill opened up about attending press conferences, acknowledging the surreal nature of the moment. \"We are at the BCCI headquarters,\" Gill said with a smile. “It's a very office kind of a feeling which I am not very used to. So it's a fun feeling. I've done plenty of press conferences. Obviously, this is different.” With just minutes to go before facing the media, Gill revealed that captaincy press conferences demand a different mindset. “The captain's press conferences are like, they are different to the one-on-one, the post-match press conference that you do, that's for sure,” he explained.

        "content": "In a display of warmth and sharp wit during India’s diplomatic mission in Washington DC, after the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor shared an unexpected moment; not with a foreign diplomat, but with his own son! While addressing a room full of journalists, foreign policy experts, and diplomats, a familiar voice from the crowd caught Tharoor’s ear. It was his son, Ishaan Tharoor, a global affairs columnist for The Washington Post. With a grin and a touch of mock protest, Shashi Tharoor quipped, “That shouldn’t be allowed. This is my son,” sparking laughter throughout the room. Laughs all around as Shashi Tharoor answers a sharp question from his son Ishaan “That shouldn’t be allowed, that’s my son!” pic.twitter.com/KI5DdX9oHJ — Shashank Mattoo (@MattooShashank) June 5, 2025 Tharoor’s Savage Reply After His Journalist Son Ishaan Working For Washington Post Confronts On Proof Against Pakistan Shashi Tharoor delivered a sharp and composed response after his journalist son, Ishaan Tharoor, confronted him with tough questions about evidence against... pic.twitter.com/qcIyOXQoha — Augadh (@AugadhBhudeva) June 6, 2025 Ishaan, enjoying the moment, introduced himself with dry humor: “Ishaan Tharoor, Washington Post. Definitely asking a question in a personal capacity. Mostly to say ‘Hi’ before you go off to your next engagement.” As Ishaan took the microphone, his father slipped into classic dad mode, gesturing for him to raise it higher. Then came Ishaan’s sharp question. He asked whether any foreign governments demanded proof of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack. Shashi responded with a chuckle, “I’m very glad you raised this, Ishaan. I didn’t plant it. I promise you. This guy does this to his dad.” Turning serious, Shashi clarified that “no one had any doubt,” and noted that India hadn’t been asked for evidence by any governments they’d engaged with, though “two or three” media outlets had raised the issue. “India would not have done this without convincing evidence,” he asserted. He supported his stance by citing familiar patterns; a “37-year legacy” of cross-border terrorism and Pakistan’s consistent denials, from the 26/11 Mumbai attacks to the discovery of Osama bin Laden near a Pakistani military compound. “They will dispatch terrorists, they will deny they did so until they’re actually caught with red hands,” he said. A post shared by Asian News International (@ani_trending) Shashi Tharoor also dismissed suggestions of American mediation. Addressing past US claims of facilitating peace between India and Pakistan, he made it clear India had no interest in such efforts. “Mediation is not a term that we are particularly willing to entertain,” he stated. “You’re implying an equivalence which simply doesn’t exist... There is no equivalence between terrorists and their victims.” Shashi acknowledged expressions of concern from senior US officials, but emphasized that if Washington was making diplomatic calls, it was Pakistan that needed convincing. The exchange between father and son quickly spread across social media, delighting netizens. One user dubbed it a “Classic Indian dad moment,” while another commented, “Raise your mic – just parent things.” A cricket enthusiast chimed in with, “Arjun Tendulkar bowling to Sachin Tendulkar.” Another summed it up with perfect desi flair: “Beta ek numberi, baap dus numberi.” See Also: Shashi Tharoor’s Scathing Review Of Donald Trump Goes Viral; Internet Wants Him As India’s Foreign Minister",

        "content": "New Delhi: Veteran leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, who was part of India's two World Cup-winning campaigns, on Friday announced his retirement from all forms of cricket after a career spanning more than two decades to undertake a \"new journey\" that he did not specify. The 36-year-old made the announcement via an Instagram post. \"After more than two decades on the field, the time has come to bid adieu to the beautiful game,\" Chawla wrote. \"Though I step away from the crease, cricket will always live within me. I now look forward to embarking on a new journey, carrying with me the spirit and lessons of this beautiful game,\" he said. Chawla was a member of India's T20 and ODI World Cup-winning squads in 2007 and 2011 respectively. He represented India in three Tests, 25 ODIs, and seven T20Is, taking 43 wickets across the three formats of the game. \"From representing India at the highest level to being part of the victorious 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup squads, every moment in this incredible journey has been nothing short of a blessing. These memories will forever remain etched in my heart,\" Chawla said in the post. He thanked his coaches, teams and IPL franchises for playing a part in shaping his career, and described his time in the popular T20 league as \"a special chapter in my career.\" \"A heartfelt thank you to the IPL franchises who placed their trust in me - Punjab Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings, and Mumbai Indians. \"The Indian Premier League has been a truly special chapter in my career, and I have cherished every moment playing in it. I owe my deepest gratitude to my coaches - Shri K.K. Gautam and Late Shri Pankaj Saraswat-for nurturing and shaping me into the cricketer I became,\" he said. \"Today is a deeply emotional day for me as I officially announce my retirement from all forms of international and domestic cricket,\" he added. The leg-spinner was a part of KKR's 2014 IPL-winning team and hit the winning runs for the Gautam Gambhir-led side in the summit clash against the Punjab Kings in Bengaluru. \"A special mention to my late father, whose belief in me lit the path I walked. Without him, this journey would never have been possible,\" he stated. Chawla made his competitive cricket debut at 15, and also represented India Under-19 and Uttar Pradesh Under-22 sides. He burst onto the scene when he bowled Sachin Tendulkar with a googly in the Challenger Series 2005-06, and made his his first-class debut at 17. Chawla has over 1000 wickets across formats in domestic cricket.",
